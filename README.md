# OpenAI Assistant POC

GLaDOS voice assitant that runs my home. You can:
1. Ask any question you can think of that you would normally ask chat GPT
2. Ask it some internet questions which I will document below
3. Ask it to turn on entities in your home via home assistant
4. Speaks a snarkky glaodos response, to the speaker of your choice with home assitant


**Note: The home assistant functinaliy is limited ot my home currently with my specific
devices and device names. I also have a custom GLaDOS TTS engine running.


### Internet Questions
You can ask it the following internet questions. These questions will expand as
I build more function calls. Hopefully one day i can have a generic browser search
function call.
